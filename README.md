# Bean Drop Station
The Bean Drop Station is a 'smart bin' that is able to identify, sort and reject cups as part of cup return process in the Bean Drop Process Cycle. Customers return used Bean Drop Cups to the Bean Drop Stations to credit their accounts with a cup refund deposit.

It uses a combination of sensors including; cameras, load cells, rfid scanners and light sensors to identify cups being returned. The Bean Drop station is designed to reject cups that are not part of the system and quarantine cups that are damaged or have items missing such as cup lids. Linear motion is used to sort the cups being returned into different sections/compartments in the internal bin storage, so allow easy sorting and collection by Bean Drop employees later on. The Bean Drop Station also uses a combination of screens (LCD and e-paper displays), buttons and sound to communicate and interact with customers. The Bean Drop stations are fully independent solutions which can run on battery power indefinately and communicate using cellular networks and the mqtt protocol.
